# BD Hijri Date API

This is a simple API to fetch the Hijri (Islamic) date for a given Gregorian date based on moon sighting in Bangladesh, as per the Islamic Foundation Bangladesh.
## How to Use the API

### Endpoint
- Base URL:  
  `https://bd-hijri-dates.qomar.workers.dev/`

### Request Format
To get the Hijri date for a specific Gregorian date, you can make a request with the following format:

```
https://bd-hijri-dates.qomar.workers.dev/?date=DD-MM-YYYY
```

### Example
For example, if you want to get the Hijri date for March 10, 2025, your request will look like this:

```
https://bd-hijri-dates.qomar.workers.dev/?date=10-03-2025
```
